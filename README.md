## Introduction
This is a text file reader written in JavaScript.
- User can enter locally saved .txt file to browser
- Text file is displayed on screen for user
- User can then evaluate the text file.
- Evaluation checks each type of word, how often it occurs and if that occurrence is a prime number

## Technologies:

Built with:
- Javascript
- Jasmine
- Html
- CSS

## Installation

- clone this repository
- in project root directory run  ```open index.html``` in the command line
- this should prompt you to your preferred browser: the url should look similar to: ```file:///Users/johnashton/Desktop/Projects/JS/file_text_reader/index.html```  Depending on your PWD.
- run tests with ```open SpecRunner.html``` in the command line
- this should prompt you to your preferred browser: the url should look similar to: ```file:///Users/johnashton/Desktop/Projects/JS/file_text_reader/SpecRunner.html?spec=```  Depending on your PWD.

## Usage

- Download and save a text file to use locally.
- Load index.html page into browser ```open index.html ```
- Click "Choose file" button.
- Search locally hosted text files and choose which to upload.
- Press button "Evaluate text" to have the text file evaluated.
- **NOTE** Large text files do take awhile to evaluate but do evaluate so be patient and wait. Best tested on small text files to see functionality.

## Testing

## Retrospective

- Built project in JavaScript but would like to look into taking the project further with other technologies such as React and re-build it.
- For large files the evaluation of text takes a long time.  Would like to look into making the project run faster.
- Fully functioning project which I'm happy with.
